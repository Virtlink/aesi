# Workspace Setup

1.  In Eclipse, import two projects into the workspace:

    - `/bundles/aesi-eclipse`; and
    - `/externaldeps`.

2.  Run or debug the `aesi-eclipse` project as an _Eclipse Application_.

3.  In the newly opened Eclipse instance, in the default workspace `/home/daniel/runtime-EclipseApplication`, create a new Java project named `testproject`.

4.  In the project's `src/` folder, create a new file `test.aesi`.

5.  Give the file some content.

6.  Create a new AESI Run configuration.

7.  Invoke the run configuration. The debugger should start.
